![Mayeen's github stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=Mayeen4536&show_icons=true&theme=dark)

I am very much Passionate about Programming, Research, and Sports.
Always motivated and love to take new challenges.
My greatest strength is to find fast and effective solutions to problems.
Being fond of playing and watching sports as an individual who is also pursuing engineering is a quirky factor about me,
which eventually helped me to keep a good balance in lifestyle and made me more communicative.
